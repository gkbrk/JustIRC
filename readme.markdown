#What is SimpleIRC#
SimpleIRC is a single-file IRC library that allows you to write simple IRC bots without having to deal with large frameworks. It's designed to be simple rather than feature-rich. That doesn't mean it doesn't have the necessary feautures for an IRC bot though.

SimpleIRC is;

* Event-based.
* Handles pings automatically so you don't have to
* Written in pure Python. Uses sockets instead of heavy frameworks.
* Has simple functions for most IRC functionality. You don't have to touch a line of socket code.

#Examples#
[ParrotBot](examples/parrotbot.py) - A bot that replies to you with the same message, just like a parrot.

#Documentation and Examples#

The library is quite new so I haven't found the time to document it yet. I will try adding some examples soon.
